License: SIL-Open-Font-1.1
 All Rights Reserved.
 Source is a trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States

 This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
 This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:

 -----------------------------------------------------------
 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open
 framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
 others.
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
 including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
 sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
 derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
 any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
 license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives.
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s)
 under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files,
 build scripts and documentation.
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
 statement(s).
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
 substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original
 Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
 environment.
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or
 other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
 of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute,
 and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
 following conditions:
 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original
 or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains
 the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
 stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
 machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
 fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s)
 unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright
 Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to
 the users.
 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified
 Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
 and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
 distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any
 other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
 apply to any document created using the Font Software.
 TERMINATION

 Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2
 .
 "Software" means the React software distributed by Facebook, Inc.
 .
 Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software
 ("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable
 (subject to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary
 Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
 transfer the Software. For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under
 Facebook's rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications
 to the Software made by you or any third party or (ii) the Software in
 combination with any software or other technology.
 .
 The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
 if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
 directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
 Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate
 affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or
 in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
 its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
 to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its
 subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent
 infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a
 patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is
 unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate
 under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.
 .
 A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is
 necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.
 .
 A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect,
 or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim.
