Description: PostgreSQL Audit Extension
 The pgAudit extension provides detailed session and/or object audit logging
 via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility.
 .
 The goal of pgAudit is to provide PostgreSQL users with capability to produce
 audit logs often required to comply with government, financial, or ISO
 certifications.
 .
 An audit is an official inspection of an individual's or organization's
 accounts, typically by an independent body. The information gathered by
 pgAudit is properly called an audit trail or audit log.
