# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  It is recommended to use systemd
# "dropin" feature;  i.e. create file with suffix .conf under
# /etc/systemd/system/pgbackrest.service.d directory overriding the
# unit's defaults. You can also use "systemctl edit pgbackrest"
# Look at systemd.unit(5) manual page for more info.
